# Robit
Robits game created in Python using graphics.py 

Game created in Python using the Graphics.py library.  
This is a pretty complete build of a game.  Intended features of game are all working in a pretty stable manner.

inspired by a similar robots game I played in Linux Gnome forever ago...
